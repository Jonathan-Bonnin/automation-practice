The test `ProductTitleHasPrecedence()` is here because if user looks for "dress" it will also show items that are not dresses, because the Search feature also searches for the company description, and it contains "dress". I think it's at best a weird behavior, because user does not care about other items and this can create confusion and worse UX. Personally, I would omit the company description shown in items from the search, but I had no influence on that I would want to have at least some test that checks if the title of an item is more important than the description of the company that sells the item. 

Here's the test run:

The test that fails is because the old price value (pre-discount) is used to sort items. In my opinion this is wrong and user would want to sort by current price value, so this is something I would flag to the relevant team (and correct the test if they push back saying it's the expected behavior).
